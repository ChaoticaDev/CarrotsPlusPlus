# Carrots++ for Linux

This is the Linux version of Carrots++.  Linux is the most "stable" and twice (or more) as fast as windows.


# ( Linux Dependencies ) *required*
 *MYSQL: apt-get install mysql
 
 *g++: apt-get install g++
 
 gcc: apt-get install gcc (recommended)
 
 sqlite: apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
 
If you'd like, you could simply remove references in code if you don't need sqlite or mysql.
